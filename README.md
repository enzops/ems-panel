I created this web panel to manage an hospital in my previous RP server. This tool was usefull compared to the google sheet we've firstly made.
After the server was closed, I decided to share.

This is my first web development, so there is a lot of errors, that's not optimized, sometimes it's just some coopies from stackoverflow...
