I created this web panel to manage an hospital in my previous FiveM RP server. This tool was usefull compared to the google sheet we've firstly made.
After the server was closed, I decided to share.

This is my first web development, so there is a lot of errors, that's not optimized, sometimes it's just some coopies from stackoverflow...
